<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
<p>This plugin is part of my Engineering Thesis and it&#39;s the first iteration of it. In future, it will be heavily updated, with even better performance (however it&#39;s perfectly usable right now on projects of any scale), will most likely come with
  a price and a detailed YouTube video, as well as more example levels (2D setup, wall climbing setup, tile-based setup, etc.)</p>
<p>Documentation, detail instructions and performance guidance will be available in the coming days.</p>

<p>* It should work on all platforms supported by Unreal Engine 5, however it has only been packaged and tested on Windows.</p>
