# CPathHostProject
This is a space where I develop Customizable Pathfinding plugin for UE5. Later on, I will also include my Engineering Thesis and documentation.

As of now, my development of this version of the plugin has stopped. 
To distinguish it from my version which is available on the Marketplace, 
I switched the default branch to PublicBranchForContributors.

I personally will not track all the changes made to this branch and I can't guarantee that the plugin from this branch will work properly.
